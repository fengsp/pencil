/// The HTTP Error type you can return from within your views to trigger a
/// non-200 response.  Here is one usage example:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use pencil::{Request, PencilResult, PenHTTPError};
/// use pencil::http_errors::NotFound;
///
///
/// fn view(_: &mut Request) -> PencilResult {
///     return Err(PenHTTPError(NotFound))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Pencil comes with a shortcut that can be used to return non-200 HTTP error easily:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use pencil::{Request, PencilResult};
/// use pencil::abort;
///
///
/// fn view(_: &mut Request) -> PencilResult {
///     return abort(404)
/// }
/// ```
